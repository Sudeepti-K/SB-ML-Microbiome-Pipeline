#Integrated pipeline for the in-silico analysis of 16s rRNA raw sequence microbiome data.
#This code can be used for performing Taxonomic Classification (Multiple levels (1-6): Phylum-Species), Functional Profiling (Multiple levels:1-3, 4: KO annotation), and vizualization (Bar graph, Spider Chart).
#Install Parallel-META 3 from http://bioinfo.single-cell.cn/parallel-meta.html, extract and install software.
